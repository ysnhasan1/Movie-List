# Movie-List
`This website created for my internship at "Turkcell Group Company Atmosware"` <br><br>

## About The Project
In this project, I wanted to create a Movie-List using HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, React.js, Redux Toolkit and React Hook Form. <br>
Users can list their favorite movies on this website. <br>
Users can easily add the movies they want to their list, and update or delete existing movies in their list. <br>
Users can find the movies in the list by using filtering movie name. <br>
Users can sort the movies alphabetically. <br>
Users can also view the details of the movies. <br><br>

## Project Dependencies
To install packages, run the command `npm install`. <br> 
Then, to start the project, run `npm start`. <br> 
Important Note: You'll need a unique **API key** to access the initial 20 movies. <br><br>
